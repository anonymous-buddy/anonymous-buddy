🎨 HACKER CULTURE & MINDSET
🏴‍☠️ The Hacker Ethos
🔓 Information wants to be free
🛡️ Security through obscurity is not security
🎯 There is always another way
🧠 Curiosity kills cats, but creates hackers
⚡ If you're not breaking things, you're not learning
🌊 The best defense is a good offense
🎪 Essential Mindset Shifts

Think like an attacker, defend like a guardian
Question everything, trust nothing
Failure is just another learning opportunity
Persistence beats raw talent every time
The network is the battlefield
